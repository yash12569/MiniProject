                <p class="blog-text">
                    As an ambitious, fast growing company, you want the best. The best engineers. The best sales
                    and support teams. The best ideas. So why do so many businesses not follow suit when opening
                    a new office?
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="assets/blogImage/1.png" alt="office room" width="800" height="500">

                <p class="blog-text">
                    The reality is, there are 117 things that need to happen between deciding to open a new
                    office and moving in. Each step requires different research, different vendors, and
                    timelines. The number of decisions that need to be made can be overwhelming, especially if
                    your team hasn&apos;t been through the process before. And it&apos;s expensive! Opening an
                    office isn&apos;t part of your daily operations, so how can you be sure you&apos;re applying
                    best practices?<br><br>
                    Many companies approach a move with a mindset similar to the one they use to develop
                    products: execute fast, make mistakes, learn from them, iterate, repeat. Unfortunately, some
                    things can&apos;t be fixed without significant financial repercussions — like choosing the
                    wrong location or space, or getting stuck with bad lease terms. But some things can be
                    fixed. The office can be remodelled or the business could move again, but that means
                    spending even more time and money, and constantly disrupting your employees&apos; work
                    lives, impacting productivity. Testing and iterating works for business, but when it comes
                    to an office expansion or move, it eats into your company&apos;s precious resources.
                    <br><br>
                <h4>Panning Expansion: Always Too Late (But Doesn&apos;t Have To Be)</h4>
                <br>
                More often than not, companies put off expansion until it is critical. As you keep hiring
                and squeezing more people into your already cramped office, the need for more space becomes
                a ticking time bomb!

                <p class="blog-text">
                    But opening an office the right way takes time. When the process is rushed, you throw money
                    at the problem to get it done. This puts you at risk of long-term financial obligations that
                    can derail your business, like overpriced rent or vendors who take advantage of your
                    situation. Between deciding where to open your new office, negotiating the lease, choosing
                    vendors, designing, building and moving in, there are so many details that need to be
                    carefully considered and navigated to deliver a space that you&apos;ll love without breaking the
                    bank.<br><br>

                    <b>So many steps, so many (possible) mistakes</b><br><br>

                    Many companies task ownership of the expansion project to someone internally who is already
                    overburdened with their own full time job, and for whom this isn&apos;t their core competence.
                    We&apos;ve interviewed over 30 companies in the past few months who did just that for their last
                    build-out (and had cautionary tales to tell). Even if your employees are exceptional (and we
                    bet they are), without expertise, they&apos;ll spend long hours stumbling over the unknown
                    unknowns and continually requiring time from the C-suite as the project explodes in
                    complexity. Their normal day-to-day duties are often either neglected or spread across the
                    team, and that&apos;s not a good use of your people.
                    <br><br>
                    The incredible attention to detail required to open your next office takes expertise. In
                    partnership with a great broker, someone who lacks experience may be able to find the right
                    square-footage and a decent office layout, but do they know how to evaluate an architect&apos;s
                    proposal? Have they considered more cost-effective furniture solutions? Or insist on better
                    sound-proofing in the conference rooms (to reduce distractions and keep confidential calls
                    confidential)? And that cool, rustic office kitchen with the unfinished wood counter that
                    the architect thought would be a beautiful touch? It can&apos;t be effectively cleaned
                    (salmonella!), and annoying splinters abound. If the security system doesn&apos;t meet your
                    industry specific compliance standards, the business could be at risk for intruders or
                    theft, and even lose customers. Mistakes like these add up fast and could be fatal for your
                    company.<br><br>

                    <b>An expert saves you time, money (AND stress)</b><br><br>

                    Since details are what make or break this process, it pays to have someone who knows the ins
                    and outs, from start to finish. An expert can properly evaluate cities, sites, and potential
                    tax breaks, ensure you&apos;re getting the right design and operational parameters met, manage
                    the buildout and move, and ensure your business won&apos;t suffer during the transition. You come
                    out of the journey with an amazing new space, on-time and on-budget, while your employees
                    continue to focus on their core responsibilities — creating your best-in-class
                    product.<br><br>
